# Keep in Mind

Many important features are __disabled by default__, such as [auto-reconnect](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Auto-Reconnect-with-Supervisor), [ngrok tunneling](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Share-Accounts-With-A-Reverse-Proxy) (for sharing accounts), Discord webhooks, and much more.

If you want to enable these features or configure a proxy ([or multiple](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Proxy-Multiple-Accounts)), you'll need to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki).
